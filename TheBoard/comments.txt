  }

  // *** 
  // when typing 'grunt' in cmd, the log of the update
  // that nodemon does is displayed, every time a js file changes. 
  // other files like css, json etc. are not cached in the browser,
  // so no need to define them in gruntfile.js.
  // to stop the nodemon from running, press 'ctrl+c'. 
  // that way, the grunt won't perform the auto update,
  // and the server will send data each refresh.
  // usually usefull for dev without debugger.
  // because when debugger is neccesery, the server side refresh is needed.
